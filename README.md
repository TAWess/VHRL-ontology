# VHRL-ontology
In this repository is stored the code for the ontologies created in the paper 'Knowledge Representation for a Human Rights Chatbot'. Three ontologies were created, each representing one iteration of the ontology design pattern. The ontologies were created in Protègè and are stored in the OWL syntax.
